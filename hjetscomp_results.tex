\section{RESULTS}
\label{sec:hjetscomp:results}

In the following comparisons, we will typically show the central
values of each prediction on the left (both as absolute predictions
and in ratio to a reference prediction), and a similar comparison of
the predictions with uncertainty bands on the right. The reason for
the former is that with the overlapping uncertainty bands, it can be
difficult to discriminate the behavior of the central predictions. But
it is also useful to compare the uncertainty bands from each
prediction given similar prescriptions for scale variation.  Note that
it is not enough to say that different predictions agree within their
scale uncertainty bands. In most cases, the predictions should be held
to a higher standard, as the scale logs are common to all of the
calculations that are being compared.

\subsection{Inclusive observables}
\label{sec:hjetscomp:results:inclobs}

This section contains observables which characterize the $h\pl$jets
phase space in the most inclusive way. Only the presence of a Higgs
boson is required, with no restrictions on its momentum. We therefore
compare the predictions for the rapidity and transverse momentum
distributions of the Higgs boson. The latter is differentiated into
two cases: its inclusive spectrum and its exclusive spectrum vetoing
the appearance of any jet. Also, to get a first overview on the amount
of jet activity accompanying the Higgs boson production, we look at
the inclusive as well as exclusive cross sections for various jet
multiplicities predicted by the different approaches.

    uncertainties. To enhance visibility, the \NNLOPS and \MEPSatNLO
    predictions are grouped together and shown with respect to the same reference
    curve in the upper and lower ratio plots, respectively. The
    reference prediction is taken from the NNLO accurate description
    of inclusive $h$ production.}
\end{figure}

We start by examining the inclusive Higgs boson rapidity distribution in
Figure~\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:inclobs:hy}. While the absolute
predictions are given in the top panel, the plots in the bottom panel
depict the respective ratios to the NNLO prediction. For better
visibility, we have divided the predictions into two groups based on
their simulation type and/or claimed accuracy. The upper ratio plot
contains the NNLO predictions while the lower one shows those obtained
from different strategies to merge matrix elements plus parton showers
at NLO. Overall, we find very good agreement in the description of the
shape of the Higgs boson rapidity distribution. The main source of deviations stems
from the different normalizations given at NNLO or NLO and the
different (core) scale choices. As expected, the \Sherpa \NNLOPS and
\Powheg \NNLOPS results agree well with the fixed order NNLO prediction. 
\Sherpa \NNLOPS' larger fluctuation wrt.\ to \Powheg \NNLOPS' stem from 
it being computed directly rather then reweighted from a NLO computation. 
Consequently, \MGaMC, \Sherpa \MEPSatNLO and \Herwig have slightly lower (NLO)
normalizations.  Here, the \MGaMC scale choice reducing to
$m_h$, rather than $\tfrac{1}{2}m_h$, is clearly noticeable. The upper edge of
the \MGaMC uncertainty band (equal to a scale that reduces to $\tfrac{1}{2}m_h$)
agrees with the central value of the other NLO ME+PS
predictions. There are no major differences in the size of the
uncertainty envelopes, although to some extent, the NNLO scale
uncertainty bands are smaller than those at NLO, as expected. Note
that the NLO-based predictions fall off more rapidly at higher $y$
than the NNLO-based predictions do. This is expected because of the
influence of additional $\ln(1-x)$ corrections present in the
determination of NNLO PDFs. Similar effects can be observed in going
from LO to NLO.

    to the one as given by \HqT.}

    the previous figure, apart from switching to a new reference curve
    which has been obtained from \Powheg \NNLOPS.}
\end{figure}

In Figures~\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:inclobs:hpt} and
\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:exclobs:hpt}, the inclusive and exclusive
(i.e.~vetoing jets above $30$\gev) Higgs boson transverse momentum
distributions are shown, respectively.  For the former, the ratios in
the bottom panel are taken with respect to the \HqT result, while
\Powheg \NNLOPS serves as the reference for the latter case. In
general, good agreement is found, with differences being somewhat more
pronounced in the exclusive case. For the inclusive version of the
$p_\perp(h)$ observable, the good agreement is observed with \HqT,
with some larger deviations evident at very low $p_\perp$. Here the 
resummation properties of the different parton showers dominate the 
spectra of the matched and merged predictions. While the
\Sherpa \NNLOPS curve starts about 15\% higher than both \HqT and \Powheg 
\NNLOPS at low $p_\perp$ it approaches the \HqT results at high $p_\perp$ 
in the fixed-order region. At the same time, \Powheg \NNLOPS follows 
\HqT closely up to scales of $\sim m_h$. Beyond that value, the 
dynamical scale employed \Powheg \NNLOPS accounts for the ensuing 
difference. The multi-jet merged calculations, due to their similar 
scale choices, follow the pattern of the \Powheg \NNLOPS prediction.
Note that the differences in \MGaMC's central scale
choice becomes less significant as the Higgs boson transverse momentum
increases. \Herwig clearly provides the softest spectrum and \Sherpa
as well as \MGaMC predict a noticeably different shape for the Sudakov
suppression at low $p_\perp$. This is not covered by the \HqT
uncertainty envelope. We refrain from showing any fixed order
prediction here because they are neither stable nor reliable at low
$p_\perp$ in the Sudakov region where resummation effects play a 
dominant role.

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:exclobs:hpt}, the
exclusive version of $p_\perp(h)$ exhibits deviations among the
predictions that become more sizable. The $p_\perp(h)$ distribution 
declines much faster, easily spanning three orders of magnitude 
between zero and $100$\gev. This observable is less straight forward 
than the inclusive $p_\perp$-spectrum as not only Sudakov effects 
dominate the low-$p_\perp$ region, but resummation effects are also 
entering through the veto on any jet activity. It thus necessitates 
both a proper description of small $p_\perp(h)$ region as well as 
jet production. Thus,
this is a stringent test of all predictions combining matrix elements and parton showers (ME+PS), as
the high transverse momentum of the Higgs boson is produced by a
combination of soft jets (those that are below the $30$\gev threshold)
and soft gluon radiation. Note that the comparison is now taken with respect to
\Powheg \NNLOPS. The inclusive 
NNLO calculation is shown to exemplify the failure of a fixed-order 
calculation on both accounts, and, thus, only the parton showered 
predictions are included in the study of the respective differences. 
Among them, apart from the differences already seen in the inclusive 
spectrum, both \NNLOPS calculations agree very well with one another, 
remaining within the 20\% uncertainty bands throughout the spectrum. 
While \Sherpa \MEPSatNLO remains mostly flat with respect to the \NNLOPS 
predictions, both \MGaMC and \Herwig exhibit difference in shape also 
also at larger transverse momenta. In the case
of \Herwig, they even grow larger than 40\%. 
From the resummation (i.e.~parton-shower)
point of view, all predictions are at the same level here, although
formally the \NNLOPS techniques lead to a more accurate description of
the exact zero-jet bin. The NLO merging approaches reduce to an \NLOPS
treatment in this zero-jet bin. It is however hard to infer this
formal difference from the behavior of the scale variation bands as
they are very comparable in size among all predictions. We conclude
that the deviation of the predictions probably provides us with a
better reflection of the true uncertainty.

    ratios with respect to the \Powheg \NNLOPS prediction. The upper of these plots
    contains the \Hej and \Sherpa \NNLOPS ratios, while the middle one
    includes all NLO merged predictions (\MGaMC, \Herwig and \Sherpa)
    and the lower one shows all those listed in the bottom left legend
    of the main panel.}
\end{figure}

To obtain a first impression of how the different predictions 
compare beyond the zero-jet bins ($n_j\ge0$ and $n_j=0$) we 
look at the various inclusive and exclusive $n_j$ cross sections.
Accordingly, Figure~\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:inclobs:njets} shows,
to the left, the inclusive ($n_j\ge N$) and, to the right, the
exclusive ($n_j=N$) jet multiplicity distributions up to $N=3$ 
using the previously defined \antikt jets with $p_\perp>30\gev$. Two
statements can be made before discussing the individual results in
more detail: first of all, the agreement between all results is
remarkable, and second, the details of the comparison are barely
altered when going from the inclusive description to the exclusive
description of the jet cross sections, apart from the obvious fact
that the exclusive jet bins always lie below the respective inclusive
jet bins. Although not shown here, when increasing the minimum jet-$p_\perp$ 
threshold to $50\gev$ the picture does not change significantly. 
Again, the bottom panels are split up into several ratio
plots with the common reference provided by the \Powheg \NNLOPS
results. The upper ratio plot depicts the \NNLOPS methods together
with \Hej, which only starts at $N=2$. Due to the scale choices in either 
\NNLOPS calculation they share a common inclusive cross section, with 
\Sherpa rising above \Powheg for higher jet multiplicities. Conversely,
\Hej undershoots by 30\% in the two-jet bin, where all predictions in this 
panel are LO accurate. In the three-jet bin, \Hej retains the LO accuracy 
while in both \NNLOPS calculations it is described by their respective 
parton showers only. Naturally, here the differences between the \NNLOPS 
predictions are largest. Please note, that the respective parton showering 
uncertainties are partially incorporated in the \Sherpa \NNLOPS uncertainty 
estimate while they are not assessed for \Powheg, resulting in a very flat 
uncertainty band. The central ratio plot confronts the NLO
matched and merged predictions with each other and against the common reference 
\Powheg \NNLOPS. All these predictions have claim NLO accuracy for $N=0,1,2$ 
and overlap well within uncertainties where the lower value for \MGaMC can 
again be attributed to the different scale choice. For $N=3$ only the \Sherpa 
\MEPSatNLO prediction retains its NLO accuracy while \MGaMC and \Herwig 
revert to LO, which is nicely reflected in the uncertainty estimates. 
Unsurprisingly, in the $N=3$ case, described by the reference with its 
parton shower only, all three NLO merged calculations predict larger 
cross sections.

Lastly, fixed-order predictions are shown for all jet multiplicities
at NLO (provided by \GoSam+\Sherpa) for the $1$-jet, $2$-jet and
$3$-jet bins and at approximate NNLO (labeled nNLO, provided by \Loopsim) 
for the $1$-jet and $2$-jet bins.
Complete NNLO predictions are shown for the 0-jet inclusive and
exclusive bins using \Sherpa without PS and for the 1-jet inclusive
bin using the prediction of Boughezal et al.~(BFGLP).
In addition, the zero-jet bin comparison
also contains the resummation prediction of Stewart et
al.~(STWZ) whereas the comparison for non-zero jet bins also
shows the \Minlo enhanced NLO calculations. All of the above are
grouped together in the lower ratio plot. For the zeroth bin, nice
agreement can be found between \Powheg and \Sherpa \NNLOPS as well as
the STWZ approach; the uncertainties also are of comparable
size. In the $1$-jet case, \Powheg (being NLO accurate in this bin)
resides 10\% above the pure NLO prediction, which simply is triggered
by the different scale choices. Unlike the inclusive Higgs boson
production case, the NNLO corrections for inclusive $1$-jet production
are small -- slightly negative for the central scale choice as given
in Eq.~(\ref{eq:bfglpScale}). There is a notable decrease in the scale
uncertainty with respect to the NLO band given by \GoSam+\Sherpa. The $2$-jet bin
shows the \GoSam NLO prediction just slightly above \Powheg, which
gives a LO prediction in this case. For the same reason, the \Powheg
uncertainties in the higher jet multiplicities are probably
underestimated. In the $3$-jet bin (both inclusive and exclusive), the
\GoSam+\Sherpa and \Sherpa \MEPSatNLO predictions clearly signal the absence of 
NLO corrections 
in the other predictions. The \Loopsim results for $h+j$ and
$h+jj$ are always somewhat below the respective \GoSam result
though the relatively large MC generation cut of $25$ \gev mean
the total rates predicted using \Loopsim should be interpreted with care.
Furthermore, compared to the NLO benchmark, the \Minlo approach
predicts 10-20\% larger cross sections for all non-zero jet bins.
Note that the \Minlo ratio for inclusive
$h+jjj$ turns out to be outside the plot range appearing at around
$1.65$ where the lower edge of the uncertainty band is seen kicking in
at a ratio value of $1.5$. In the cases where NNLO precision is available
the reduction in scale uncertainty is clear. For $n_j\geq1$ the variation around
$\mu_R=\sqrt{\Sigma_T}/2$ is about $5.5\%$ while for $n_j\geq0$ it is about $10\%$
around $\mu_R=m_h/2$. The latter result can be improved using the N${}^3$LO prediction
of Anastasiou et al. \cite{Anastasiou:2015ema} to only a few percent. In order to compare more
easily with results presented previously in the literature we give numerical values at NLO and NNLO
for different scale choices in Table \ref{tab:H1jXS}. As observed previously \cite{Boughezal:2015dra},
the convergence of the total cross-section is improved for scales that limit to $m_h/2$. The dynamical scale
of $\sqrt{\Sigma_T}$ defined in eq. \eqref{eq:bfglpScale} is slightly harder than the fixed scale given the
minimum jet $p_{T,j}>30$. On the other hand it is softer than $\hat{H}_T'$ defined in eq. \eqref{eq:hthatprime} which explains
the differences at NLO.

\subsection{One-jet observables}
\label{sec:hjetscomp:results:1jobs}

In this section, we move away from the fully inclusive picture and
require the presence of at least one jet associated with the Higgs
boson. In some cases we also ask for the predictions where exactly one
jet is being resolved. Recall that the jets are defined based on the
anti-$k_T$ algorithm using $R=0.4$; they furthermore have to obey the
criteria that $p_\perp(j)>30\gev$ and $|\eta(j)|<4.4$. The set of
observables presented here includes the transverse momentum
distributions of the Higgs boson $h$, the leading jet $j_1$ and the
$hj_1$ two-body system as well as the rapidity spectrum of the leading
jet.

    predictions (first and fourth subplot), the NLO merging
    predictions (second and fifth subplot) and the fixed-order
    predictions (subplot in the middle).}

    corresponding ratios wrt.~the \Powheg \NNLOPS result. From top to
    bottom, the predictions are grouped such that the \NNLOPS results,
    the ME+PS results at NLO and the fixed-order results are compared
    directly in the first, second and third ratio plot, respectively.}
\end{figure}

The Higgs boson transverse momentum distribution in the presence of at
least one jet is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:1obs:hpt}. The exclusive version of
this plot, i.e.~where one requires the $hj$ final states to be exact,
is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:1obs:hpt_excl}.  As
for the zero-jet cases discussed earlier in
Figures~\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:inclobs:hpt}~and~\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:exclobs:hpt},
the one-jet $p_\perp(h)$ variables are prone to large, maybe sligthly
stronger, Sudakov effects that arise at low $p_\perp$ but also beyond
this area, in particular for the exclusive final states. Moreover, the
Sudakov shoulder effect can be observed for all fixed-order
predictions shown here. The jet-$p_\perp$ threshold leads to a
non-smooth behaviour of the $p_\perp(h)$ observable at LO, and
therefore to the existence of a critical point at $30\gev$ for which
the cancellations between real and virtual soft-gluon singularities
will be imperfect at any given fixed, higher order in perturbation
theory~\cite{Catani-Webber}. For the NNLO $hj$~\cite{.} prediction, an
averaging procedure has been used to dampen the effect around the jet
threshold while for the NLO predictions, the large oscillations are a
clear indication of the instability emerging at the jet threshold.
Comparing the different fixed-order predictions, which is done best by
looking at the ratio plot in the middle, noticeable differences only
occur between the NNLO prediction and the four NLO predictions as
obtained from \Powheg and the three version of \GoSam+\Sherpa (pure
NLO, \Minlo and \Loopsim). The NNLO tail is harder by about 15\% which
is expected since the $p_\perp$ tail is affected by multi-jet
contributions. The NNLO treatment includes these contributions to a
larger extent, as it respectively includes $h\pl2$-jet and
$h\pl3$-jet contributions at the NLO and LO. Another difference is
that for $p_\perp(h)\to0$, the NNLO description gets closer to the
resummed result (\Powheg) because it reproduces more terms of the
all-orders expression than the pure NLO predictions do. However, it
can be noticed that apart from \Powheg and BFGLP's NNLO $hj$
calculation, all other approaches predict a more steeply falling
shoulder when $p_\perp(h)\to0$ resulting in a significantly lower
intercept point with the $\hat y$-axis.

\Todo{Don't have a good explanation why Powheg and BFGLP are so
  different regarding intercept ... anybody else?}

For larger $p_\perp(h)$ values, $p_\perp(h)>70\gev$, in general there
is good agreement between \Powheg, \MGaMC, \Sherpa and the NLO curves;
this can be expected as these predictions are all NLO-accurate. As
before, \Herwig tends to be softer, whereas \MGaMC using the nominal
$\tfrac{1}{2}m_h$ core scale turns out to be harder by almost 40\% as
inidcated by the upper edge of the corresponding uncertainty band, see
second or last subplot to the right in
Figure~\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:1obs:hpt}. \Sherpa's \NNLOPS
prediction also features a harder tail than \Powheg owing to the
different scale setting procedures employed by the two approaches.
While in \Powheg the scale setting is accomplished through the \Minlo
procedure, \Sherpa uses the fixed scale choice of $\tfrac{1}{2}m_h$
and therefore enhances the $p_\perp$ tail wrt.~\Powheg's result. We
furthermore observe that apart from the BFGLP NNLO computation, all
uncertainty envelopes are of similar size, which does not come as a
surprise because all of these predictions are effectively given at
NLO. The NNLO uncertainty band (shown in grey) is found to be
significantly smaller. Comparing the second and last ratio plots with
each other, we also notice that the ME+PS predictions are in better
overall agreement with the pure NLO prediction given by \GoSam+\Sherpa
than they are in agreement with \Powheg. This may be a result of the
global scale choice, cf.~Eq.~(\ref{eq:bfglpScale}), used by the NLO
calculation as it seems to be a more decent proxy to the ME+PS local
and dynamical scale setting procedures than it is one to the \Powheg
approach.

For the exclusive one-jet case, we reduce the number of ratio plots
and show only those that display the ratios to \Powheg in the same way
as before. Note that for the exclsuive version of the observable, the
NNLO result is not available turning this comparison into one between
NLO-accurate predictions, except for the NNLO-approximate result given
by \Loopsim, labelled \GoSam $hj$ nNLO.
Figure~\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:1obs:hpt_excl} clearly shows that
the differences among the results are very similar to those discussed
in the inclusive case; they are however pronounced such that the
deviations wrt.~the \Powheg \NNLOPS prediction for $h$ production
become larger for the full tranverse momentum range. There is one
exception to this: \Loopsim predicts a softer tail of the $p_\perp(h)$
distribution by about 20\%. \Todo{Not quite sure why that is.}

    plots are displayed in the lower part of the plot using the

\end{figure}

Next we discuss the leading jet transverse momentum distribution for
$h\pl\ge1$-jet final states. For this type of observable, we do not
expect large Sudakov effects (i.e. shifts owing to parton
showering/resummation). The impact of jet veto logarithms (owing to
the restriction that all jets be greater than $30\gev$) has been
examined and found to be reasonably small at NLO and
NNLO~\cite{monni}. \Todo{provide numbers from Monni?} \Todo{MS: Dowe have any?}
In the exclusive jet case, the $p_\perp(j_1)$ variable however is
prone to larger resummation effects, and we note that the scale
uncertainties shown will not reflect the true uncertainty. The
inclusive jet results for all approaches are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:1obs:j1pt} including the NNLO
prediction of the BFGLP group and the prediction of Stewart, Tackmann
et al. Figure~\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:1obs:j1pt_excl} depicts the
exclusive one-jet case presenting the results obtained by the Monte
Carlo tools only; no fixed-order predictions are shown. Accordingly,
different reference predictions (NNLO and \Powheg) are used in the
ratio plots associated with
Figures~\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:1obs:j1pt} and
\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:1obs:j1pt_excl}; for the inclusive one-jet
scenario, two additional ratio plots are displayed using the NLO
\GoSam+\Sherpa reference but otherwise correspond to the upper two
ratio plots. \Todo{these last two rplots may be removed since BFGLP
NNLO == GoSam NLO here} Overall we find a rather remarkable agreement
between all results where the largest deviations rarely exceed the
20\% mark. For the exclusive lead-jet transverse momentum distribution
of Figure~\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:1obs:j1pt_excl}, this means that
all predictions are in reasonably good agreement with \Powheg. The
\MGaMC prediction is lower than \Powheg for basically the entire
transverse momentum range, again because of the central scale choice
being higher than in the other approaches. For the inclusive lead-jet
transverse momentum spectrum (see
Figure~\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:1obs:j1pt}), the remarkable
agreement implies that all predictions indeed lie within each other's
uncertainty bands. The quoted uncertainties are similar in size, with
values at and around the 20\% level, and only those of the BFGLP NNLO
calculation and the \MGaMC simulation using the higher central scale
turn out to be significantly smaller and somewhat wider, respectively.

Despite the good agreement seen among all predictions in
Figure~\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:1obs:j1pt}, it is worthwhile to go
through the ratio plots and discuss some of the interesting features.
In the second panel, the two \NNLOPS predictions are compared to the
NNLO $h\pl\ge1$-jet prediction. The agreement among all three is
good at low transverse momentum, but at higher $p_\perp(j_1)$ there is
a tendency for \Sherpa \NNLOPS to be slightly higher and \Powheg
NNLOPS to be slightly lower, resulting in a 20\% net difference
between the two. Again, this is a result of using
$\mu=\tfrac{1}{2}m_h$ within \Sherpa versus using \Minlo within the
\Powheg approach. In the third panel, \Herwig, \Sherpa and \MGaMC
(taking into account its larger limit scale) agree reasonably well
with each other over the entire transverse momentum range, but fall
about 15\% low wrt.~the BFGLP prediction in the mid-range of the
$p_\perp$ distribution. The fourth panel shows that there is almost no
difference in normalization nor shape between the NNLO and the NLO
$h\pl\ge1$-jet predictions using the given scale choice,
cf.~Eq.~(\ref{eq:bfglpScale}). This extends to the \Minlo reweighted
NLO result and the nNLO prediction provided by \Loopsim, although the
latter is somewhat softer. In the fifth panel, the STWZ prediction
agrees with the NNLO prediction at low $p_\perp$, but rises up to 30\%
higher at the largest $p_\perp$ values. As mentioned earlier, in the
bottom two panels, comparisons are made to the NLO $h\pl\ge1$-jet
prediction, basically reproducing the results of the first and second
subpanel as the similarity of the NNLO and NLO curves is perfect for
the scale choice given by Eq.~(\ref{eq:bfglpScale}).

In summary, the fixed-order NNLO prediction of the BFGLP group, which
has the best theoretical uncertainties available, is in good agreement
with the \Sherpa predictions (\NNLOPS and \MEPSatNLO), and to a
somewhat lesser extent with the other ME+PS predictions. The level of
moderate disagreements observed with the latter may be due to the
somewhat different scale choices that are still important at
NLO. There is no sign of any serious impact of the merging of the
fixed-order predictions with parton showers, as expected for such an
inclusive cross section.

Did we talk about great agreement in the previous case where we
discussed the $p_\perp(j_1)$ distribution, the agreement found for the
rapidity distribution of the lead jet, $y(j_1)$, is magnificient, as
demonstrated by Figure~\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:1obs:j1y}. We were
to expect that due to the $p_\perp(j_1)$ agre and earlier findings
concerning $y(h)$, see Figure~\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:inclobs:hy}.
We basically do not observe any shape differences, and the rate
differences follow the already established pattern where most
noticeably the \MGaMC cross section is reduced owing to their choice
of using a higher central scale. Again, uncertainty envelopes are
by and large similar in size and do not point to any shape changes
when varying the scales; \Herwig's band is slightly narrower while
\MGaMC's band is somewhat wider compared to all other NLO-accurate
predictions.

We finish this section by examining the results for the transverse
momentum of the Higgs-boson plus leading-jet system. In other words,
we are interested in studying the different answers in describing the
recoil of the $hj_1$ system. In the inclusive one-jet case depicted in
Figure~\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:1obs:hj_pt}, the system may recoil
against a second jet (or secondary jets) plus soft radiation, while
for the exclusive jet scenario shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:1obs:hj_pt_excl}, it is only soft
radiation that recoils against the $hj_1$ system. The latter case will
therefore be strongly affected by the level at which resummation is
taken into account. Formally, for the observable in question, the
predictions of highest accuracy are facilitated by the NLO merging
approaches as they provide an NLO description of the second jet; all
other predictions are only LO accurate, i.e.~larger differences can be
expected. In the exclusive ($=1$-jet) case, all predictions that
include parton showering operate at the same level of precision
while the fixed-order calculations cannot do anything but fail in
describing the $p_\perp(hj_1)$ distribution.

For the $h\pl\ge1$-jet events, differences of $\mathcal{O}(30\%)$ are
observed among the ME+PS predictions below the jet threshold, while
there is better agreement at higher $p_\perp$ values, where again
\Herwig turns out to be on the softer side. The \Powheg curve
surprisingly fits right in with the ME+PS results, while \Sherpa's
\NNLOPS prediction only starts deviating for larger $p_\perp$ yielding
a 40\% increase at $p_\perp\sim400\gev$ (again owing to the different
treatment of scales in both approaches). The mostly comparable
behaviour of the \NNLOPS results to those obtained from NLO merging is
not what one expects a priori, however the NNLO matching seems to
constrain the parton showers in a beneficial way (via sophisticated
choices for setting the renormalization, factorization and resummation
scales) such that the LO+PS treatment of the $h\pl\ge2$-jet rate
obtains a more appropriate normalization. The $hj$ NLO calculations
(i.e.~the pure and \Minlo reweighted \GoSam+\Sherpa results) cannot
compete with this performance since the scale setting is global and
the second-jet description is purely one of LO accuracy.
Correspondingly, the $p_\perp(hj_1)$ observable is described poorely
with values clearly overshooting below the jet threshold due to the
missing Sudakov suppression and undershooting by 60\% beyond
$p_\perp=50\gev$ due to missing higher (than two-) jet multiplicity
contributions. It is interesting to see that the \Loopsim procedure
lifts this large discrepancy in the $p_\perp$ tail. The good agreement
with the ME+PS results is largely driven by the $hjj$ NLO component
used to build the nNLO prediction for the $h\pl\ge1$ process. As a
result of the cut-off dependence of the procedure nothing however can
be said about the $p_\perp<25\gev$ region. Lastly, we comment on the
uncertainties quoted by the different calculations: the \GoSam, \Minlo
and \Loopsim envelopes have an appropriate size reflecting the
underlying LO nature of the prediction, and similarly for \Sherpa's
\NNLOPS result. \MGaMC and \Herwig produce NLO variations that are
fairly different in size. However, the \Herwig as well as the \Powheg
envelopes are most likely underestimated, in particular the \Powheg
band does not behave as expected from a LO variation.

The exclusive (exactly one jet) case in describing the $p_\perp(hj_1)$
observable is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:1obs:hj_pt_excl}.
Apart from the \NNLOPS outcomes, there is a much greater divergence of
the predictions for exactly one jet, especially at high $p_\perp$.
Recall this time the recoil is generated only from soft emissions, and
it is clear that a highly exclusive distribution such as the one in
question serves as a stress test for the ME+PS as well as \NNLOPS
predictions (in fact any parton shower or resummed prediction). For
the same reason, caution has to be taken in interpreting the shown
uncertainties. The current case is similar to the case for the Higgs
boson $p_\perp$ distribution with no jets and it is no surprise that
different approaches can lead to different answers. Most notably, we
observe the expected complete failure of the \GoSam results (including
the \Loopsim result where the one-jet requirement obliterates the
effect that yielded the improvement in the inclusive case),%
\footnote{Owing to the kinematic constraints on the jets, harder
  radiation that goes forward does not get identified as a jet;
  these contributions actually form the (naively unexpected)
  $p_\perp>30\gev$ tail of the \GoSam results though the mechanism is
  highly suppressed.}
the much more severe decline of the \Herwig differential cross section
for larger $p_\perp$ and \NNLOPS predictions that are in much better
agreement as compared to the inclusive case.

The Higgs boson $p_T$, in the presence of at least two jets, is shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:2obs:hpt_j2pt}. Here, varying

than Powheg at low $p_T$ and somewhat higher at high $p_T$, while
Herwig7 is somewhat lower than Powheg at high $p_T$. The gosam
$H+\ge2$ jet prediction is lower than Powheg at low $p_T$ (as expected
for a Sudakov region),and roughly 10\% higher at high $p_T$ (closer to
the MG5/Sherpa predictions).

The sub-leading jet $p_T$ for $H+\ge2$ jets is shown in the upper row

among the ME+PS predictions and between the ME+PS and fixed order
predictions of gosam is better than in the case of the leading
jets. With two or more jets in the final state, meaningful predictions
to HEJ can be made for the first time.

The sub-leading jet $p_T$ for $H$ + exactly 2 jets is shown in the
lower panel of Figure~\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:2obs:jet2_pt}.
Here, MG5, Sherpa and Herwig7 lie in reasonable agreement with each
other, but systematically lower than Powheg.

slope with respect to Powheg at low $p_T$ and being somewhat higher at
high $p_T$, while Herwig7 is again somewhat lower than Powheg at high
$p_T$. The gosam $H+\ge2$ jet prediction is much higher than Powheg at

\subsection{VBF observables}
\label{sec:hjetscomp:results:VBFobs}

A situation where Higgs boson production in gluon fusion primarily serves 
as background is found in analyses intended to measure its couplings to weak 
vector bosons. To enhance the relative contribution 
of processes where the Higgs boson production proceeds through weak vector 
boson fusion (VBF) additional cuts are placed on the so-called tagging 
jets. The tagging jets themselves can now be defined in multiple ways. 
In the study performed during the Les Houches 2013 workshop 
\cite{AlcarazMaestre:2012vp} the standard leading ($p_\perp$-ordered) jet 
selection was supplemented with the forward-backward selection defining 
the pair of jets with the largest rapidity separation as tagging jets. 
Another strategy using the highest invariant mass jet pair were also studied 
\cite{Greiner:2015jha}. 

In this analysis, the leading and sub-leading jets are required to have a
a mass greater than 400 GeV and a rapidity separation greater than 2.8. This set 
of cuts is referred to as VBF cuts. An alternative set of cuts (VBF2) requires
that any two jets satisfy the above requirements. In many cases, the distributions
are similar for the two cases, and only the VBF cut scenario will be presented. 
%In the present study, we generalised these 
%definitions, defining the tagging jets as the leading pair of 
%$p_\perp$-ordered jets which fulfils the thereupon applied cuts. 
%Of course, differences between the schemes only manifest themselves in 
%the presence of at least three jets and are, thus, formally of higher 
%order. Numerically, however, they can have a major impact and their 
%choice depends on the physics aims of the analysis to be performed. 

%In our analysis, requiring the tagging jet invariant mass and rapidity 
%separation to be in excess of $400\,\gev$ and $2.8$, respectively, 
%prepares the typical VBF kinematics. Now, the contamination of these 
%observables with the irreducible background of Higgs produced in gluon 
%fusion is a key quantity in the accuracy of the extraction of the coupling 
%parameters. We thus proceed to analyse the congruence of the different 
%descriptions of a selection of key observables with the standard tagging 
%jet using the leading and sub-leading $p_\perp$-ordered jets. Results 
%for the alternative choice can be found at \cite{webpage}.

cuts are shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:inclobs:njets_VBF} (Figure~\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:inclobs:njets_VBF2).
 The hierarchy observed
is essentially the same as for the inclusive jet multiplicity
distribution without any cuts. The differences among the predictions
are slightly smaller with the VBF2 cuts than with the VBF cuts.

%Nonetheless, the number of gluon fusion events passing the VBF 
%selection criteria it therefore predicts a significantly smaller 
%VBF cut efficiency. 
For the $\ge 2$ jet bin, the NLO merged predictions vary from a 20\% 
smaller cross section (\MGaMC) to a 20\% larger cross section 
(\Sherpa \MEPSatNLO); both are at the edge of 
the \NNLOPS uncertainty band. Interestingly, their uncertainty is of 
similar size as  \NNLOPS, $\sim$20\%, despite being of NLO 
accuracy for these observables (only LO for \NNLOPS). This hints 
at  underestimated uncertainties of the \NNLOPS calculations for 
this observable. The NLO and \Minlo \GoSam{}+\Sherpa predictions are 
also 20\% larger than the \NNLOPS result in the $\ge 2$ jet bin, close to the \Sherpa \MEPSatNLO 
prediction, while the \Loopsim prediction exceeds the \NNLOPS predictions 
by about 5\%. 
%Their uncertainties are all one-sided and with about 20\% 
%of the same relative size as the NLO multijet merged uncertainties.
More differences are apparent after requiring a third jet. The  
NLO and \Minlo \GoSam{}+\Sherpa predictions are substantially larger than the 
\NNLOPS predictions and the prediction from \MGaMC, but in better agreement
with that from \Sherpa \MEPSatNLO. This is expected given the NLO normalization
present in those calculations (NLO,\Minlo \GoSam{}+\Sherpa, \Sherpa \NNLOPS). The third jet  arises
from parton showering in the \NNLOPS calculations and from a leading order matrix element in \MGaMC.
%The \NNLOPS calculations drop with respect to 
%all other ones due to their thrid jet desription coming entirely from 
%their parton showers' soft-collinear approximation. Otherwise, the 
%picture remains unchanged. The fixed-order cross-section again is in 
%rough agreement with the \Sherpa \MEPSatNLO one, their uncertainties,
%however, manifesting themselves differently.

The $H_T$ distribution (sum of the transverse momenta for all objects

distribution for jets only is shown in in
Figure~\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:mobs:HT_jets}. \Todo{Jan: we don't
  consider $H$ decays, so the all-objects HT would be different from
  an experimental point of view. Do we want both HTs and clarify or
  only the HTjets.}
MG5 and Sherpa tend to be lower than Powheg at low $H_T$ and higher at
large $H_T$. The fixed order predictions (from gosam and from $H+\ge1$
jet at NNLO) are consistently lower than Powheg (although the NNLO
prediction does agree with Powheg in the 150-300 GeV range for
$HT_{jets}$).

\subsection{Jet veto cross sections}
\label{sec:hjetscomp:results:jvobs}


In this section, we investigate jet veto cross sections, where the phase space for
additional gluon radiation is suppressed by means of a jet veto. 
%This section is concerned with the cummulative jet veto cross sections. 
In  Figures 
\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:jvobs:jvxs0}-\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:jvobs:jvxs1j200}, 
additional radiation has been vetoed by the application of a maximal transverse 
momentum for the (sub)leading jet, $p_\perp^\text{veto}$. The observables plotted
in the figures recover the respective inclusive cross sections as 
$p_\perp^\text{veto}\to\infty$. In this region, the fixed order 
part of the respective calculations dominates the cross section 
and associated uncertainties. The opposite regime, where $p_\perp^\text{veto}\to 0$, 
is a classic example of a resummation-dominated observable. Here, the 
properties of the respective parton showers come fully into play and 
differences are largely due to their separate characteristics. 
%The last case 
%investigated is cross section after VBF cuts when vetoing additional 
%central jet activity in dependence of the rapidity distance of the 
%tagging jet pair, $y_\text{dist}<y_\text{dist}^\text{max}$. Here, 
%DGLAP-type resummation regions are present throughout the spectrum and 
%this observable should be ideal to study BFKL-like dynamics.

  }
\end{figure}

We start by considering 
the cross section for the production of a Higgs boson and no 
additional jets, as a function of the minimum jet transverse momentum 
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:jvobs:jvxs0}. Remarkable 
agreement between both \NNLOPS simulations and the dedicated resummation 
calculations of STWZ is found, typically better than 5\% within the considered range. 
However, as the resummation accuracy for both \NNLOPS' implementations is limited by their parton 
shower's accuracy and they do not (\Powheg) or only partially (\Sherpa) 
assess their intrinsic resummation uncertainties and the interplay with the hard process 
scale variations, their uncertainties are less well-determined than those of STWZ. Although
the uncertainties for STWZ are similar to those of the \NNLOPS predictions for low values of the
jet veto transverse momentum, they are significantly smaller for higher values, perhaps reflecting the
effects of the $\pi^2$ resummation effects included in STWZ.
 The multijet merged predictions have a wider variation, and have veto cross sections lower than
that provided by the STWZ and the NNLOPS predictions. In addition to 
suffering from their NLO normalisation in the $p_\perp^\text{veto}\to\infty$ 
limit, they also show different behaviour as $p_\perp^\text{veto}\to 0$. For example, 
\Sherpa \MEPSatNLO exhibits more QCD activity than the other computations.

    \label{fig:hjetscomp:results:jvobs:jvxs1j200}
  }
\end{figure}

Next, we require the presence of at least one jet with 
a minimal transverse momentum of either $30$ or $200$ \gev. 
The cross sections as a function of 
the sub-leading jets’ maximal transverse momentum are displayed in 
Figure~\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:jvobs:jvxs1j30} and 
Figure~\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:jvobs:jvxs1j200} for the two lead jet cuts. 
Note that, although all parton 
shower matched or merged calculations have the same accuracy both as 
$p_\perp^\text{veto}\to\infty$ and in the resummation dominated region, 
the multijet merged calculations possess a better description of the 
second jet emission, and thus should lead to more accurate results 
throughout the spectrum, provided the merging systematics are under control. 
Currently employed uncertainty estimates, however, will not reflect this 
as resummation uncertainties are not assessed or only incompletely assessed.

If we put no special requirements on the leading jet, cf.\ Figure 
\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:jvobs:jvxs1j30}, good agreement 
between all calculations is found. The \NNLOPS predictions agree again within 
5\% of one another and have very similar uncertainties. This is noteworthy 
in sofar as, in comparison with the results of 
Figure~\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:jvobs:jvxs0}, both calculations' 
accuracies are degraded by one order. The multijet merged calculations 
show similar behaviours as in the previous case: \MGaMC exhibits a smaller cross section due to 
its scale choice while \Sherpa \MEPSatNLO predicts more soft radiation. 
The relative lack of small $p_\perp$ radiation is more 
pronounced in \Herwig for this observable. Again, the uncertainties of \MGaMC and \Sherpa 
are of similar size while those of \Herwig are somewhat smaller than those of the \NNLOPS 
predictions, especially in the resummation-dominated region 
$p_\perp^\text{veto}\to 0$.

Raising the requirements on the leading jet to $200$ \gev, in Figure 
\ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:jvobs:jvxs1j200}, displays clear distinctions 
between the different calculations.  
\Sherpa \NNLOPS and \Powheg \NNLOPS have noticeably different shapes, with \Sherpa having a 
much lower cross section for low values of the sub-leading jet veto requirement. 
%starts out at a higher asymtotic cross section but remains within 
%20\% and of \Powheg, the respective uncertainties covering one another. 
The multijet merged calculations show \Herwig largely agreeing with 
\Powheg with a constant offset of $-10\%$, and the familiar lower 
probability of low-$p_\perp$ jet emissions. 
The asymptotic cross section for \Sherpa \MEPSatNLO is similar to that from \Sherpa \NNLOPS and, 
unsurprisingly, due to the use of the same parton shower, shows a 
similar radiation pattern. As before, it exhibits 
a relative overabundance of soft jet radiation. Lastly, the asymptotic cross section from \MGaMC 
is the same level as \Powheg's, despite 
its higher scale choice. The pattern of the uncertainties, however, 
remains the same as before.

%\Todo{The central jet veto cross sections are a mess. Looking into the 
%      analysis this is Ivan's code. It defines $y_\text{dist}$ as the 
%      minimal rapidity distance between the centre of the forward and 
%      backward jets and any jet inbetween,
%      $$
%	y_\text{dist}\;=\;\min\limits_{j|y(j_\text{bw})<y(j)<y(j_\text{fw})}
%	                  \left|y(j)-\frac{y_\text{fw}+y_\text{bw}}{2}\right|\;.
%      $$
%      It can thus take the maximum value of $4.4$. The cummulative cross 
%      section is then defined as 
%      $\sigma_2(y_\text{dist}>y_\text{dist}^\text{min})$. Thus, this 
%      observable vetoes events with too central additional radiation. 
%      It has one flaw in the implementation, however, in the absence of 
%      any third jet $y_\text{dist}$ is set to $>4.4$. Its asymtotic behaviour 
%      at large $y_\text{dist}$ converges thus to the exclusive VBF 
%      cross section, instead of zero. I just do not see what kind of 
%      dynamics we are probing or what kind of relevance a construction 
%      like this has. Especially since the forward backward jet are 
%      generally not the VBF tagging jets. We do also have the same observable 
%      in the pure dijet selection, which would then at least be nicely defined. 
%      Only the effects there are even smaller. 
%      Too many cooks, I guess. One should have had a recipe first.

% Finally, we consider the cross section after VBF cuts applying a veto 
% on additional central jet activity with $p_\perp>30\,\gev$ in dependence 
% of the maximal rapidity distance of the tagging jets, 
% $y_\text{dist}<y_\text{dist}^\text{max}$, as displayed in 
% Figure \ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:jvobs:cjvxsvbf}. Here, all parton shower based 
% resummation calculations give very similar results with \MGaMC possessing 
% a reduced cross section due to its scale choice. \Hej, being based on 
% BFKL dynamics, does not deviate substantially in its predicted shape. 
% However, its cross section is reduced by a constant 50-60\%. Alternatively, 
% when applying the generalised version of the VBF cuts, labelled VBF2, 
% a similar picture presents itself in 
% Figure \ref{fig:hjetscomp:results:jvobs:cjvxsvbf2}. While, of course, the 
% asymtotic cross section at large $y_\text{dist}^\text{max}$ coincides with 
% the one of the standard VBF cuts, for small $y_\text{dist}^\text{max}$ the 
% generalised VBF cuts allow for a much larger cross section.
