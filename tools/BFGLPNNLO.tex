\subsubsection{NNLO calculation of $pp\to h+j$}
\label{sec:hjetscomp:tools:fo:BFGLP}

The NNLO calculation for Higgs production in association with one or 
more jets is obtained using the $N$-jettiness subtraction 
scheme~\cite{Boughezal:2015dva,Gaunt:2015pea}.  The application of 
this technique to obtain the full NNLO result for Higgs+jet, and its 
validation against another calculation using sector-improved residue 
subtraction~\cite{Boughezal:2015dra}, was described in 
\cite{Boughezal:2015aha}.  In this study we adapt the dynamical scale choice
%
\begin{equation}
\mu_0 = \tfrac{1}{2}\,\sqrt{m_{h}^2+\sum p_{T,j_i}^2}
\end{equation}
%
for both the renormalization and factorization scales, where the sum 
runs over all reconstructed jets.  This dynamical scale correctly 
captures the characteristic energy throughout the entire kinematic 
range.  To estimate the theoretical uncertainties we equate $\mu_R$ 
and $\mu_F$ and vary them in the range $\mu_0/2 \leq \mu_{R,F} \leq 2 \mu_0$.  
We use \texttt{CT14nnlo} parton distribution functions 
\cite{Dulat:2015mca}.  Jets are reconstructed using the anti-$k_T$ algorithm 
with $R=0.4$, subject to the requirements $p_T>30$ GeV and $|\eta|<4.4$.
