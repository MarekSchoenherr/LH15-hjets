\subsubsection{\Powheg \NNLOPS}
\label{sec:hjetscomp:tools:nnlops:powheg}

One of the generators under investigation is the \NNLOPS prediction 
of Higgs boson production via gluon fusion~\cite{Hamilton:2013fea}.
To produce this sample, the Higgs-boson-plus-jet \Minlo~\cite{Hamilton:2012np} 
predictions generated with \PowhegBox{}\texttt{-v2}~\cite{Campbell:2012am} 
are combined with an NNLO accurate analytical calculation by the 
program \HNNLO (v.2.0)~\cite{Catani:2007vq,Grazzini:2008tf,Grazzini:2013mca} 
following the instructions in \cite{Hamilton:2013fea}. Here, the rapidity 
spectrum of the Higgs boson of the \Powheg \texttt{HJ} \Minlo prediction 
is reweighted with the spectrum from \HNNLO, while ensuring that NLO 
precision is kept for the kinematic properties of the first additional jet. 
In the generation and the \HNNLO calculation, the default parameters are 
set as follows, in particular the renormalization and factorization scales 
have been set to $\mu_R = \mu_F = \tfrac{1}{2}\,m_h$ and the 
\texttt{MMHT2014nnlo68cl} \cite{Harland-Lang:2014zoa} has been used. 
To evaluate the uncertainties in the choice of the renormalization and 
factorization scales, the 21-point scale variations described in detail 
in \cite{Hamilton:2013fea} are evaluated.
The \NNLOPS sample is showered with \Pythia~8 (v.8.253) \cite{Sjostrand:2014zea} 
using the \texttt{NNPDF} \texttt{2.3} leading-order PDF set~\cite{Ball:2012cx} 
and the A14 tune~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2014-021}. 

The variation of the renormalization scale also varies consistently the 
resummation scale in the Sudakov form factor of the \Minlo 
procedure~\cite{Hamilton:2012rf}. Other resummation properties are not 
varied in this simulation.
