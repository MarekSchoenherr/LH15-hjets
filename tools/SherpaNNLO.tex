\subsubsection{NNLO calculation of $pp\to h$}
\label{sec:hjetscomp:tools:fo:sherpa}

For the fully differential calculation of inclusive Higgs production 
at NNLO accuracy we use the implementation in the \Sherpa Monte Carlo 
event generator presented in \cite{Hoche:2014dla}, in this case without 
matching it to the parton shower. This calculation is performed using the 
$q_\text{T}$-slicing technique and was extensively 
checked against \HNNLO \cite{Catani:2007vq}. For this study here we set 
$\mu_R=\mu_F=\tfrac{1}{2}\,m_h$ and use the \texttt{MMHT2014nnlo68cl} 
PDF set.
