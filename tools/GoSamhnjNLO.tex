The fixed order Ntuples used for the can be combined using the LoopSim procedure to make
an approximate NNLO prediciton which is missing the double virtual corrections but captures
much of the double unresolved radiation contributions. There is a cut-off dependence on the
additional real radiation since the fixed order Ntuples where generated with a jet $p_T>25$ GeV.

The LoopSim procedure uses a flavour sensitive $k_T$ algoritham where a jet radius of $R=1$ was used.
All other parameters are the same as in the fixed order analysis.
