\subsubsection{\Resbos}
\label{sec:hjetscomp:tools:ares:resbos}

\Resbos is the updated version of \textsc{ResBos} \cite{Balazs:1997xd}, 
which resums the effect of multiple soft gluon radiation to all orders 
in the strong coupling via the $q_T$ resummation formalism proposed by 
Collins-Soper-Sterman \cite{Collins:1984kg}. The \Resbos prediction 
of the inclusive Higgs boson production via the gluon fusion process 
includes the full NNLO QCD corrections in its total rate, similar to 
the setup of a \HNNLO calculation for the fixed order QCD calculation, and 
the NLO contribution to Higgs boson distribution at large transverse 
momentum ($q_T$) \cite{Glosser:2002gm}. In this calculation, we include 
NNLL accuracy in the Sudakov factor and NNLO accuracy in the Wilson coefficient functions 
of the resummed piece which is matched to the perturbative piece 
evaluated at the NLO at large $q_T$ \cite{Wang:2012xs}. The 
renormalization and resummation scales have been varied by a factor 
of 2 around its central value $\tfrac{1}{2}m_h$, with the 
non-perturbative parameters needed for the $q_T$ resummation calculation 
taken to be the same values as those in \cite{Wang:2012xs}. Also, 
the \texttt{MMHT2014nnlo68cl} PDF set has been used. 

The \Resbos prediction of the inclusive Higgs plus jet production via 
gluon fusion is based on the transverse momentum dependent (TMD) 
resummation formalism, in the Collins 2011 scheme \cite{Collins:2011zzd}.
It includes the NLL Sudakov factor and NLO inclusive rate in the 
resummed piece which is matched to NLO QCD prediction in the large 
$q_T$ region \cite{Sun:2016kkh}. Here, $q_T$ denotes the transverse 
momentum of the pair of Higgs boson and jet. By this, the total 
inclusive rate of Higgs plus jet, with a minimum cut on jet transverse 
momentum, will agree well with that given by the NLO calculation, such 
as the MCFM program \cite{Campbell:2010ff}. The better prediction from 
the resummation calculation is to describe the kinematic distributions 
of Higgs boson and jet when they are almost back-to-back. In this 
calculation, we have fixed the resummation scale to be the jet 
transverse momentum ($p_T(j)$), as suggested in \cite{Sun:2016kkh}, 
and varied the renormalization scale by a factor of 2 around its 
central value $\tfrac{1}{2}m_h$, with the non-perturbative parameters 
needed for the TMD resummation calculation taken to be the same values 
as those in \cite{Sun:2016kkh}. Also, the \texttt{MMHT2014nnlo68cl} PDF 
set has been used. The jets are defined based on the \antikt algorithm 
using $R = 0.4$; they furthermore have to obey the criteria that 
$p_T(j) > 30$ GeV and its rapidity $|\eta(j)| < 4.4$.
