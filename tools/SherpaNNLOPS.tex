\subsubsection{\Sherpa \NNLOPS}
\label{sec:hjetscomp:tools:nnlops:sherpa}

A second NNLO prediction matched to a parton shower is investigated 
in this study. The computation is performed in the \textsc{uN$^2$loPs} 
method~\cite{Hoeche:2014aia,Hoche:2014dla}, which is based on the 
\textsc{uNloPs} algorithm for merging inclusive NLO matched calculations 
of varying jet multiplicity, while leaving their total cross sections 
unchanged~\cite{Lonnblad:2012ix,Lonnblad:2012ng}. The event samples 
used in this comparison were generated with an implementation of the 
\textsc{uN$^2$loPs} matching scheme in the event generator \Sherpa. The 
NNLO prediction needed for the matching is computed within \Sherpa itself, 
using a $q_T$ cutoff method~\cite{Gao:2012ja}, for details see 
\cite{Hoeche:2014aia,Hoche:2014dla}. We used a parton shower based 
on Catani-Seymour dipole factorization~\cite{Schumann:2007mg,Hoeche:2009xc},
which has been matched to the Higgs plus jet NLO calculation using 
the S-MC@NLO method~\cite{Hoeche:2011fd,Hoeche:2012ft}. Renormalization 
and factorization scales for the fixed-order calculation have been 
set to $\mu_R = \mu_F = \tfrac{1}{2}\,m_h$, and the the parton shower 
starting scale is set to the same value. The \texttt{MMHT2014nnlo68cl} 
PDF set \cite{Harland-Lang:2014zoa} has been used throughout.
