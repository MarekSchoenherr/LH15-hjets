\subsubsection{Sherpa MEPS@NLO}
\label{sec:hjetscomp:tools:mc:sherpa}

We provide a multijet merged sample of Higgs boson production in 
gluon fusion in assiciation jets wherein the $h+0,1,2,3\,\text{jet}$ 
final states are calculated at NLO accuracy \cite{Gleisberg:2008ta,
  Hoeche:2012yf,Gehrmann:2012yg,Hoeche:2014lxa}. Therein, NLO QCD 
computations are matched to the parton shower using a variant of the 
\MCatNLO method \cite{Hoeche:2011fd,Hoeche:2012ft,Hoche:2012wh}.
The one-loop matrix elements are provided by \GoSam \cite{Cullen:2011ac,
  Cullen:2013saa,Greiner:2015jha} and are interfaced using the BLHA 
\cite{Alioli:2013nda} standard.

The individual jet multiplicity contributions are merged using a merging 
cut of $Q_\text{cut}=20$ GeV. The $n$-parton matrix elements are then 
clustered in the scheme of \cite{Hoeche:2009rj,Hoeche:2012yf,Gehrmann:2012yg} 
to find a suitable core configuration and defining $\mu_\text{core}
=\tfrac{1}{2}\,m_h$ for the present study. The factorisation 
and parton shower starting scales are then set directly to 
$\mu_\text{core}$ while the renormalisation scale is determined by 
through CKKW scale setting using the identified emission scales and 
the above defined core scale.
The uncertainties are assessed varying $Q_\text{cut}\in[15,30]$ GeV, 
ensuring that the description of all analysis jets always proceeds 
at NLO accuracy. Renormalisation and factorisation scales are varied 
indepently by a factor of two keeping $\tfrac{1}{2} < \mu_F/\mu_R < 2$. 
The shower starting starting scale is varied by a factor $\sqrt{2}$. 
The \texttt{MMHT2014nlo68clas0118} PDF set \cite{Harland-Lang:2014zoa} 
is used throughout.
